\section{Future work}


Future work will involve identifying problems with natural needle-in-a-haystack fitness landscapes and then closing the developmental feedback loop with as little additional machinery as possible to determine when and how such added complexity increases evolvability. In the simplest case, 
development could be explicitly suppressed when the robot begins
moving rapidly, the developmental equivalent of Hinton \& Nowlan's model.
Next, a robot may begin to undo previous development in order to make more precise midcourse corrections. Finally, development may begin to listen to signals not directly related to fitness, thus providing a more realistic natural model.
