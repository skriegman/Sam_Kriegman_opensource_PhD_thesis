    \caption{\textbf{Manufacturing modular soft robots.}
    Hollow, silicone voxels were created by partially filling an open-face mold with silicone (\textbf{a}), 
    using a spatula to spread it along the interior walls (\textbf{b}), and then securing the mold to a 1-axis rotational molding machine (\textbf{c}). This process allowed excess silicone to drip out of the mold, while spreading the remaining silicone into a thin uniform layer.
    The cured, bottomless voxels were then appropriately arranged and connected for each x,y slice of the design, and bonded with a shared bottom layer (\textbf{d}).
    Finally, tubing was attached (\textbf{e}), and the slices were stacked and bonded to form the design (\textbf{f}).
