\subsection*{The design space.}

Following \cite{hiller2012automatic} and \cite{kriegman2019automated}, our kit uses elastic voxels as building blocks of structure.
Here, we considered a \mbox{2-by-2-by-2} cartesian lattice workspace, within which voxels were connected together to form a robot.
At each x,y,z coordinate, voxels could either be passive, volumetrically actuated, or absent, yielding a total of $3^8=6561$ different configurations. 
We evaluated each configuration in simulation.
