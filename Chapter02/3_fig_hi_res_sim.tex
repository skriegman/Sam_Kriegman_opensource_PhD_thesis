    \caption{A higher resolution model in which each silicone voxel is approximated by a 3-by-3-by-3 group of simulated subvoxels: a high-res voxel.
    The design in \textbf{a} and \textbf{b} are high-res instantiations of those in Figs.~\ref{fig:transfer}e and \ref{fig:transfer}f, respectively. 
    Spherical volumetric expansion in a high-res voxel (\textbf{c}) was approximated by increasing the rest length between the centermost subvoxel and the subvoxels at center of each face (green subvoxels in \textbf{d}).
