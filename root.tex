\begin{abstract}
	
\vspace{10mm}


Data-driven, rather than hypothesis-driven, 
approaches to robot design are becoming increasingly widespread, but they remain narrowly focused on tuning the parameters of control software (neural network synaptic weights) inside an overwhelmingly static and presupposed body.
Meanwhile, an efflorescence of new actuators and metamaterials continue to 
% expand the ways and degrees 
broaden the ways
in which machines are free to 
% change during operation, 
move and morph,
but they have yet to be adopted by useful robots because 
the design and control of 
metamorphosing body plans 
is extremely
non-intuitive.
This thesis unites these 
converging yet previously 
segregated
technologies
by automating the design of robots with physically malleable hardware,
which we will refer to as protean machines, named after Proteus
% the prophetic shapeshifter
of Greek mythology.

This thesis begins by proposing an ontology of embodied agents, their physical features, and their potential ability to purposefully change each one in space and time.
A series of experiments are then documented in which increasingly more of these features (structure, shape, and material properties) were allowed to vary across increasingly more timescales (evolution, development, and physiology), and collectively optimized to facilitate 
% robot-level 
adaptive
behavior in a simulated physical environment.
The utility of increasingly protean machines is demonstrated by a concomitant increase in both the performance and robustness of the final, optimized system.
This holds true even if its ability to change is temporarily removed by fabricating the system in reality, or by ``canalization'': the tendency for plasticity to be supplanted by good static traits (an inductive bias) for the current environment.
Further, if physical flexibility is retained rather than canalized, it is shown how protean machines can, under certain conditions, achieve a form of hyper-robustness: the ability to self-edit their own anatomy to ``undo'' large deviations from the environments in which their control policy was originally optimized.

Some of the designs that evolved in simulation were manufactured in reality using hundreds of highly deformable silicone building blocks, yielding shapeshifting robots.
Others were built entirely out of biological tissues, derived from pluripotent 
\textit{Xenopus laevis} 
stem cells, yielding computer-designed organisms (dubbed ``xenobots'').
Overall, 
the results 
shed unique light on questions about
the evolution of development,
simulation-to-reality transfer of physical artifacts,
and the capacity for
bioengineering new 
organisms
with useful functions.
